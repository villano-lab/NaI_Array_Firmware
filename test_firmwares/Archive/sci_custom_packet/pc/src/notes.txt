So! Resource explorer sees our header. The code here does not.
It sees a value that is of an appropriate size, but the value is incorrect.
It is also the same value each time (within the same run, anyway), as expected.
Therefore the code runs, but rejects every single packet, and then feeds back garbage data when prompted.
Why!?
