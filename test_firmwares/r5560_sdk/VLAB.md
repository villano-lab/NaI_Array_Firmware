# How It Works

This library provides generic code to be compiled with any custom firmware that is developed on
Sci-Compiler. Having this library compile is a pre-requisite to compiling a custom firmware on the
DT5560SE device. 

The code in this directory is a copy of the library:

## Modifications

This code will _not_ work as-is, there were some minor modifications I had to do to the Makefile while running on Ubuntu 18.04.
