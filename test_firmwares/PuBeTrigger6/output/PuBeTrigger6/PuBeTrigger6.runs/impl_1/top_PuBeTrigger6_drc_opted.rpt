Related violations: <none>

REQP-125#1 Warning
connects_CLKINSEL_both_active  
main_clock_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst: The MMCME2_ADV has an active CLKINSEL, but the CLKIN1 and CLKIN2 pins are not both active.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 U0_0/U7/xpm_memory_sdpram_inst/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg has an input control pin U0_0/U7/xpm_memory_sdpram_inst/xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U0_0/U7/xpm_memory_sdpram_inst/xpm_memory_base_inst/addra[6]) which is driven by a register (U0_0/U7/WP_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
